# Data Folder: Wind Turbine Fault Prediction Project
This folder contains data files used in the Wind Turbine Fault Prediction Project. The project aims to create predictive models for Balance of Plant (BoP) fault errors in wind turbines operated by a fictional energy company called BHE. The data files in this folder were used to train and test the models developed by the project team.

## Files
- FaultCodesCSVAggregated.csv.zip: This file contains the master data on fault codes for the wind turbines. The file is in CSV format and compressed in ZIP format. The file was obtained from BHE.

- weather_data.csv: This file contains the weather data used in the project. The data was scraped from an online weather database using Python's BeautifulSoup library. The file is in CSV format and contains weather data for several locations around the wind turbine farm. Note that the location data is estimated due to a lack of specific information on the wind turbines.

- Data/work order scrubbed.csv: This file contains the work orders for the wind turbines. The file is in CSV format and was obtained from BHE. The file has been renamed and moved to the "Data" folder for organization purposes.
