## Cleaning environment
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```

```{r}
# Load packages
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

install.packages("lubridate")
library(lubridate)
```
## Importing the data
```{r}
all_turbine = read.csv(file.choose(),header=T)
```

## Making the column time_interval a time object
```{r }
# R doesn't know start_date and end_date are dates - they were read in as numeric
# convert those both to date objects
all_turbine$Time = ymd_hms(all_turbine$Time)
```

## Rounding the time_interval column to "10 minutes"
```{r}
all_turbine$interval_time = round_date(all_turbine$Time, "10 mins")
````


```{r}
